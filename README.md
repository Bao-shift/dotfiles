# Dotfiles

> This are my dotfiles. There are many like it, but this ones are mine.

> My dotfiles are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must master my life.

> My dotfiles, without me, are useless. Without my dotfiles, I am useless. I must fire my dotfiles true.
I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will...

> My dotfiles and I know that what counts in this war is not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make.
We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit...

> My dotfiles are human, even as I, because they are my life. Thus, I will learn them as a brother.
I will learn their weaknesses, their strength, their parts, their accessories, their sights and their barrel.
I will keep my dotfiles clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...

> Before God, I swear this creed. My dotfiles and I are the defenders of my country.
We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.

> So be it, until victory is America's and there is no enemy.
