# The time massaging regexes start with ^[^<]* because that ensures that they
# only operate before the first "<". That "<" will be the beginning of the
# author name, ensuring that we don't destroy anything in the commit message
# that looks like time.

# The log format uses } characters between each field, and `column` is later
# used to split on them. A } in the commit subject or any other field will
# break this.
